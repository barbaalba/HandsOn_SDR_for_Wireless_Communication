# HandsOn_SDR_for_Wireless_Communication
This repository showcases SDR implementations for channel estimation, communication, and positioning. It is an addition to the other repository called [Basic of Wireless Communication Tutorial](https://github.com/barbaalba/Basic_of_Wireless_communication_Tutorial). Moreover, the repository provides implementations using GNU Radio and MATLAB. 

**NOTE**: To open *.grc, use GNU Radio Companion. See [LINK](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/MacInstall) for installation on Mac OS.
